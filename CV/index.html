              Makes decisions on key operational issues such as the offload of
              passengers and/or baggage and cargo to ensure that the Emirates
              flight schedule is maintained in accordance with the published
              precision timing schedule (PTS). Takes accountability for, and has
              authority to make decisions on the acceptance of lastminute or
              delayed loads that could potentially delay flight departures.
              Follows the flight briefing and establishes, in consultation with
              the Emirates Duty Controller, when a delay is acceptable
              operationally and commercially. Handling documents and paperwork
              needed for every flight such as, flight plans, NOTAMs, NOTOC, PIL,
              weather reports general declaration, load sheet, and weight &
              balance.
              <br />
              <br />
              Plans a strategy for flight departures prior to commencing any
              precision timing activities after seeking and interpreting a full
              flight briefing (e.g. en-route restrictions, flight crew
              limitations etc.) via Emirates Hub Control Centre (HCC). Conducts
              a briefing to all stakeholders involved in the flight departure
              and establishes any operational shortfalls, organizing immediate
              remedial solutions within acceptable standards so that an on-time
              departure can be achieved.
              <br />
              <br />
              Manages the departure flight process by leading the EK and DNATA
              teams with a "can do" attitude that inspires those around them
              while consistently seeking to optimize the on-time performance
              and/or maximize the payload. Evaluates any anticipated delays to
              identify opportunities to further maximize payload revenue and
              enhance customer service.
              <br />
              <br />
              Maintains full contact with the Emirates Duty Controller in the
              HCC via the tetra radio network and/or the personal digital
              assistant (PDA) to allow full transparency of the critical path of
              the flight departure. This enables the Network Control Centre
              (NCC) to streamline the base station and network operations
              through effective tactical decision-making.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through ongoing relationships with flight handling agencies, such
              as fueling companies, DNATA and EK flight catering, identify and
              recommend improvements to procedures and/or standards of safety
              and security to the EKAS Operations Services Management so that
              the airline can consistently deliver the highest operational
              standards in the industry.
              <br />
              <br />
              Has full autonomy in the allocation of delay codes and timings for
              anyo ff-schedule departures. This is done by fully investigating
              PTS schedule failures so that accurate trends can be assessed for
              future service level improvements.

              Acts as the single point of contact for all frontline Dnata & EK
              teams handling Emirates flights for compiling and disseminating
              critical information and decisions. Using systems such as MACS,
              Zeus, and Opera.
              <br />
              <br />
              Demonstrates effective and proactive control over the Precision
              Timing Schedule (PTS) by recommending corrective measures to
              Dispatchers and GTL in cases of variations that could impact EK
              schedules integrity. Identifies potential conflict situations (
              belt failures or congestion at screening facilities) and devises
              recommendations to tactically resolve any potential revenue loss
              by using the situation advantageously.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the event of significant operational disruptions implement the
              recovery plan of action initiated by the management team in NCC.
              Communicate and ensure the frontline teams understand and adhere
              to directives. Update the Zeus system of all flight-related
              disruption information to enhance the decision support process. In
              consultation with EK-MAS (OS) disseminate relevant information to
              the outstations alerting them to the possible impact of delays at
              the HUB to their respective stations.

              <br />
              Track individually allocated aircraft movements to/from contact
              stands and to/from areas such as EKHangar or remote stands.
              Identify and communicate potential conflicts to the PTS and
              proactively recommend to the ASO-HCC corrective measures to
              optimize real-time stand allocation. Assesses the impact of the
              corrective action taken and proactively identifies areas of
              opportunity to optimize resources efficiently.
              <br />
              <br />
              Using all available resources (e.g. CCTV) monitor the passenger
              and baggage flow and maintains a proactive control over the
              operational process to assess the impact on operational efficiency
              and customer service standards. Highlight where the flows are
              disrupted for the ASM-HCC to correct via contact with the ASM team
              in the terminal.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through effective communication and a proactive monitoring process
              (ZEUS system), consolidate information and make recommendations to
              the ASM-HCC and Dispatcher to optimize the payload. Take into
              consideration any critical factors (e.g. FDP, commercial slots,
              return connectivity) before suggesting any decisions that may
              impact operations to achieve operational efficiency and enhance
              customer service.
              <br /><br />
              Enable the out-stations to make effective operational decisions by
              dispatching correct flight movement messages within the agreed
              published time. Where appropriate proactively alert and brief the
              outstations of potential disruptions on connectivity (e.g. heavy
              onward connections or return connections on critical departures).
              <br />
              <br />
